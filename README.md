# My Portfolio
Welcome to my Portfolio project! This is a personal website that showcases my experiences, skills, and projects. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this portfolio is designed to provide a professional online presence and an easy way for others to learn more about me.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** The layout is fully responsive and works on all device sizes, from mobile phones to desktops.
- **Project Showcase:** Displays a collection of projects with descriptions and links to my github repositories.
- **Contact Form:** A simple contact section that allows visitors to reach out to me directly from the website.

## Technologies and libraries used

- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **JavaScript**
- **Bootstrap**
- **Google material icons** (https://fonts.google.com/icons)

## Future Improvements

- **Dynamic Content Loading:** Implementing a feature to load the content for skills, projects, and experiences dynamically from external files or a server. This will make it easier to update and manage the portfolio without modifying the HTML file directly.
